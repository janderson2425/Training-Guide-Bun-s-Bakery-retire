# Training-Guide-Bun-s-Bakery

Thank you to my class mentor Zach Woodward for showing up every Wednesday and delivering pragmatic mentoring.

PROJECT LOCATION ON GITHUB: janderson2425/Training-Guide-Bun-s-Bakery-retire

Project includes a README file that explains the following:

A one paragraph or longer description of what your project is.
My project is a simple website for a fictional bakery named Bun's Bun's Bakery. This is my first coding project I've done from beginning to end. The purpose of the website is to display instructions for baking various types of baked goods and breads. It serves as a collection of recipes while giving intructions on how to prepare them. The homepage has three catergories and the subpages are broken down to include how to prepare specific types of baked goods. It was fun!

Which 3+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements.
1) CSS - A navbar that expands/collapses; goes from vertical to horizontal; flexbox on homepage and grid on subpages; nth-child; animation when hovering on content on subpages
2) JS - display of hamburger in navbar used event listener/query selector; var, if, else function to show/hide button on singular intruction page
3) Additional - media queries set to display navbar in different direction when mobile; 3 categories on subpages and homepage change from horizontal to vertical vice-versa

If needed, any special instructions required for the reviewer to run your project.

The code for my project can be found on GitHub janderson2425 and is titled "Training-Guide-Bun-s-Bakery-retire". I have tested my project on my mentor's computer. Due to the the location of the index.html, I adjusted all file paths and image paths from absolute to relative to resolve display issues. I used GitHub Pages to host my site. I have over 29 commits that have been submitted over the 3 month course.

I downloaded the same live server that was used in the Pluralsight courses to actively display my website and check how the code was looking as I was building it. I then used GitHub Pages to further see how my website was looking.
