       <h2>​Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          
          <br>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, yeast, salt and anise seeds. Set aside.</br>
        
          <br> In a bowl, whisk together, the yogurt, olive oil, and ¾ cup warm water (about 100°F). Add the yogurt
          mixture to the dry ingredients and mix with hands and knead gently into a soft, slightly sticky dough (about 5-6 minutes).</br>
          
          <br>Lightly oil a bowl (the bowl should be large enough to allow the dough to double in size). 
          Transfer the dough to the prepared bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel. Let sit in a warm place for 1 to 1.5 hours, 
          or until about doubled in size (hint: the warmer the spot, the faster the dough will rise).</br>

          <br>Dust a work surface with some of the flour and dump the dough on top. Sprinkle some
          flour on top of the dough and on your hands. Shape the dough into a long rectangle and cut into 6 equal portions, dusting with more
          flour as necessary so the dough doesn't stick. Roll each portion of dough in the bowl of flour to keep them from sticking.</br>

          <br>Warm a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat until very hot. Using a rolling pin, roll one of the dough balls
          into an oval shape about ⅛-inch thick (it should be about 9 x 4 inches). Pick up the dough and flip-flop it back and forth between
          your hands to release any excess flour; then gently lay the dough in the dry skillet and cook until the top is bursting with air 
          bubbles and the bottom is golden and blackened in spots, a few minutes. Flip the naan and cook about 1-2 minutes more until the
          the bottom is lightly browned and blistered in spots. Remove the naan from the skillet and brush with melted butter.</br>
